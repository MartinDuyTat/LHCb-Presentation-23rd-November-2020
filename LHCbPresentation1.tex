\subsection{The chemistry packages}
\begin{frame}{The chemistry packages}

We focus on two \LaTeX{} chemistry packages:
\begin{block}{The \texttt{chemfig} package}
This package provides the command which draws molecules. Created by Christian Tellechea, a detailed user guide can be found here:\\[0.4cm]
\small{\url{www.tex.ac.uk/ctan/macros/generic/chemfig/chemfig_doc_en.pdf}}
\end{block}
\begin{block}{The \texttt{mhchem} package}
The \texttt{mhchem} package provides simple commands for typesetting chemical molecular formulae and equations. Created by Martin Hensel, a detailed user guide can be found here:\\[0.4cm]
\small{\url{http://mirror.ox.ac.uk/sites/ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/mhchem/mhchem.pdf}}

\section{Using chemistry packages with \LaTeX{}}

\subsection{Chemical equations with \texttt{mhchem}}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Chemical equations with \texttt{mhchem}}

\begin{itemize}
\item The \texttt{mhchem} package lets you write chemical equations in \LaTeX{} with the minimum of effort. 
\item The example below shows how the standard representation of a reaction (on the left) is created from the simple code on the right:
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\ce{CO2 + C -> 2CO} is created with \verb|\ce{CO2 + C -> 2CO}|
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item More complicated reactions are still easy to write:
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\ce{SO4^2- + Ba^2+ -> BaSO4 v}\\[0.1cm]
is created with\\[0.1cm]
\verb|\ce{SO4^2- + Ba^2+ -> BaSO4 v}|
\end{center}

\end{frame}

\section{Where to go next\dots{}}

\begin{frame}{Where to go next\dots{}}

\begin{itemize}
\item This short example was designed to introduce you to using Overleaf for scientific presentations.
\item This is made possible by the many great packages that have been developed for \LaTeX{}, including the two we focused on here (plus the \texttt{Beamer} package used for the overall presentation style). 
\item For more help on using \LaTeX{}, see the links on the Overleaf help page: \url{www.overleaf.com/help} or check out our free introductory course: \url{www.overleaf.com/blog/7}.
